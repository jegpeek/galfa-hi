
  Sparse BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) Library

  A C++ implementation of the routines specified by the ANSI C 
  interface specification of the Sparse BLAS in the BLAS Technical 
  Forum Standard[1].   For details, see [2].
 
  This file requires three header files from the standard specification:
  "blas_sparse.h", "blas_enum.h", and "blas_sparse_proto.h".  These are
	available from [1], and included in this distribution for convenience.  
	Make sure the include files are placed in a location visible to the 
	compiler.  To compile, use something similar to

		c++ -c nist_spblas.cc

	to create an object file.  You can then convert or add this object file 
	to a library, although this is not necessary.
