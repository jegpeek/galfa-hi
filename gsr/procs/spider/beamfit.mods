following mods made to beamfit programs:

1. convergence criteria in gfit_allcal.pro changed: now responds to 
fractional change in sigma. also changed halfassed to 0.25 from 0.5.

2. dfteval.pro. now evaluates sidelobe properties using dft instead of ffteval.
also, use the real part of the result instead of its absolute value--
gives smaller errors.
