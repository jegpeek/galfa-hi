/TAPE_IO                      (VMS only)           January 1993

     This subdirectory contains procedures which use the IDL TAPWRT and
TAPRD procedure to manipulate files on tape.    The TAPRD and TAPWRT 
procedures are only available under VMS IDL, and hence the procedures in this
directory are limited to VMS.     Users on Unix machines might wish to
delete this directory

--------
FBTAPE - Read a fixed block tape to disk 
FITS2X - Read a FITS tape directly into IDL image and header variables  
FITSRD - Interactive driver to read a FITS tape into STSDAS (modified FITS)
         disk format. 
FITSRD_LARGE  - Like DFITSRD but works on large arrays, slower than
                 DFITSRD but less demanding on virtual memory.  
FITSREAD - Read a FITS tape to STSDAS format.  Called by FITSRD 
FITSREAD_LARGE - Analogue of FITSREAD, called by FITSRD_LARGE.
FITSLIST - List the headers on a FITS tape. 
FITSTAPE - Function to perform FITS tape I/O.  Called by FITSWRITE, FITSREAD
            FITS2X, X2FITS.    
FITSWRT - Interactive driver to write from SDAS format to FITS tape
FITSWRITE- Write an SDAS file to a FITS tape.  Called by FITSWRT  
FXTAPEWRITE - Copy a disk FITS file to tape 
FXTAPEREAD - Copy a FITS file from tape to disk 
TINIT - Position a VMS tape between final double EOF for appending new files
X2FITS - Write IDL image, header variables directly to a FITS tape (VMS)
