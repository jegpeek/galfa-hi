file: ~phil/idl/ReadmeExport
For exporting correlator/ri idl routines.. some of the things you need to do.
----------------------------------------------------------- 
Making the tar file to take with you:
    You can creat a tar file on disc and then ftp it to your site..
The file size is < 1mb:
	The tar file already exists at:
	~phil/idl/idl.tar. it is about 800 kb

    You can then ftp this file to your home computer.

----------------------------------------------------------- 
Installing the routines at your home institution.

    Create a directory to place the ao idl routines and a second directory 
	to hold the html documentation (that is accessible from a web 
	browser)  Lets assume you used: 
	- /share/idl/ao to store the idl procedures.
	- /home/aoidl/public_html for the directory to hold the idl html
							  documentation
	- http://www.yoursite.edu/~aoidl as the url for the directory
							  in step 2 (change the address to the 
							  correct value).


    cp idl.tar to /share/idl/ao
    tar -xf idl.tar

    If you run tar as root, be sure and include the o option (-xof) so that
    the owner of the files is the person running tar.


0. in the user's  startup file for idl add:
   !path = expand_path('+/share/idl/ao/gen')+':'+ !path

1. in /share/idl/ao/gen/aodefdir.pro
    change:     return,'/pkg/rsi/local/libao/phil/'
        to:     return,'/share/idl/ao/'
    change:     return,'/home/phil/pubilc_html/'
        to:     return,'/home/aoidl/pubilc_html/'
    change:     return,'http://www.naic.edu/~phil/'
        to:     return,'http://www.yoursite.edu/~aoidl/'

2. After you have created the html directory you an run
   @allmkdoc  

   This will create a file /tmp/idlmkall.pro and execute it. It will
   create the various html files in the aodefdir(/doc) directory.
   It deletes the /tmp/aomkall.pro file when it is done.
