  {\Large \bf Instructions for running a2011}

\vspace{0.5cm} {\large Carl Heiles, Josh Goldston 
(27 May 2005)\footnote{Adapted from
``Instructions for running a2032'' by Snezana Stanimirovic (May 22 2005).}}

{\bf If you get started more than eight minutes late, please call Josh
Goldston at 510 299 4427.}

In case of any problems or concerns please call Josh Goldston at 510 299
4427.  These are observations with ALFA and GALSPECT.  The observing
procedure consists of running a calibration routine (called Smart
Frequency Switching) and then making a map with basketweave scanning
(the observing routine is called Basketweave Scanning). 


There are four major parts to the process:
\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Starting CIMA and pointing the telescope}

\item {\bf Starting GALSPECT}

\item {\bf Running the calibration and observation}

\item {\bf Stopping at the end of the run}
\end{enumerate}


Here we go:

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Starting CIMA and pointing the telescope} \begin{enumerate}

\item On {\it observer2} login as dtusr.

\item Open an xterm and type {\bf cima}.

\item On the center window entitled ``Welcome to CIMA'' enter your name
and project number = a2011 (note ``a`` is lower case).  Then under
``Select observing mode'' select ``Line''.

\item A new window entitled ``Available Receivers'' pops up.  Click
``ALFA'', click ``Disable Quick Tsys'', and then ``Select Receiver
Now''.  This will start rotating the turret to ALFA.  Finally, click on
``DISMISS'' to get rid of this window.

\item On the ``Observers Interface'' window (upper left of screen) click
on ``Command File Observing''.  

\item A new window opens up near the upper right labelled ``Command
File Observing''.  Click ``Command file''; a new window opens up
entitled ``Select Command File''.  

\item In this new ``Select Command File'' window you see a set of files
displayed.  Our files come in pairs, a ``\_part\_1'' for pointing the
telescope and setting things up and a ``\_part\_2'' for doing the
calibration routines and the actual observations themselves.  Each pair
of files has a names like ``LWS\_day\_5''.  We want to sequentially run
through the days.  Select the next ``\_part\_1'' file by clicking on it. 
For example, if all files up to ``LWA\_day\_4'' have been observed
already, select ``LWA\_day\_5\_part\_1'. 

Then click on ``Open''.

\item Return to the ``Command File Observing'' window near the upper
right of the screen. Click ``Start Command Line Observation''.

\item At this point look at the ``AO Observer Display'' window near the
bottom right of the screen.  At the bottom left of this window the word
``Observing'' should be highlighted in green.  Also, this window prints
out a line every time it does something.  It should progress in a normal
fashion.  

The telescope should start driving to the source. 

If there are any {\it red} messages, then there is a {\it problem}.  If so, call Josh
Goldston at 510 299 4427. 

\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf Starting GALSPECT} \begin{enumerate}

\item While the telescope is driving to the desired position, login to
{\it dataview} as user ``guest'' (password is ``naic305m''). 

\item On {\it dataview}, open an xterm; the prompt \verb%[guest@dataview
guest]$% appears.  In this window, login to the {\it galfa1} computer by
typing:

{\bf ssh -i galfa\_key galfa$@$galfa1 }

The prompt \verb$#$ appears, showing that this window is now a {\it
galfa1} window. 

\item In this same {\it galfa1} window type:
{\bf ps }

This makes a list of processes running on the {\it galfa1} computer.  If
the word {\it gdiag} exists in the right hand column then either
somebody forgot to turn off the spectrometer or someone else is using
it.  If you see the word {\it diag}, then you need to kill it by
typing

{\bf kill PID }, where PID is the number in the first column.

\item In the same {\it galfa1} window type:

{\bf /var/diag }

Let it run for some time, like 30 sec, you will see lots of messages,
GALSPECT is warming up. Stop this by typing Control-C.

\item Wait until the telescope gets on the source.  Then in the same
{\it galfa1} window type:

{\bf /var/levels }

This will finish quickly and give you a short summary.  Check RMS
values, they should all be near 10.  If they are not close to 10, try
it again.  And again.  And again.  If the RMS values keep being wrong,
then call Josh Goldston at 510 299 4427. 

	\item When you type the above command there is a possibility that
you will see the message

{\bf LO2: Set failed, got back: ERROR setting freq}

{\bf ONLY} if you see this message, do the following: \begin{enumerate}

	\item Open up a new xterm on {\it dataview}.

	\item login to wappserv as user wapp (password=wappme) by typing

{\bf ssh wapp@wappserv}

It will ask for the password: type {\bf wappme} .

	\item Type

\verb$ source /share/wappsrc/bin/start_gpib$

	\item Then return to the previous step where you type
\verb$/var/levels$ in the {\it galfa1} window.

\end{enumerate}

                                                                        
\item FINALLY! We are set to observe! In the {\it galfa1} window type:

{\bf /var/a2011}

Again, note that ``a'' is lowercase.  Typing this starts GALSPECT and
it will beigin to write data files with the GALSPECT. It will begin to
write bunches of numbers on the {\it galfa1} window.

\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf Running the calibration and observation} \begin{enumerate}

\item Return to cima on {\it observer2}.  In the upper right window
labeled ``Command File Observing'' again click ``Command file''; a new
window opens up entitled ``Select Command File''. 

\item This time select the ``\_part\_2'' file of the same day as the ``\_part\_1'' file you selected before. Click ``Open''

\item Return to the ``Command File Observing'' window near the upper
right of the screen. Click ``Start Command Line Observation''.

\item The first action is a calibration, which takes a few minutes. This
must finish before the telescope starts moving, so we try to leave
plenty of time.  As a result the telescope might not start moving for
several minutes; this is not a problem. 

\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf Optional step during observing: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!} 

	At any time during observing you can view data using GALSPECT's
display: \begin{enumerate}

\item Open a new xterm on {\it dataview} and type:

{\bf vncviewer galfa1} 

This brings up a plot entitled ``TightVNC: Pixmap framebuffer''.

\item With the cursor on this plot window, type ``a'' three times.

\item Move the cursor to this {\it plot window} and type ``h'' once.

\item With the cursor on this plot window, type ``L''.


\item At this point you should see seven plots, one for each of ALFA's
beams.  Each plot has two graphs, one yellow and one green.  They should
look similar, like a flat-topped lemon-lime birthday cake viewed from the
side (yum-yum!).  In the very center should be a narrow 21-cm line with
height about the same as that of the cake; regard the line as a birthday
candle in the very center of the cake. 

	These plots should continually update once per second. If this
doesn't happen, then call Josh Goldston at 510 299 4427. 

\item The G-ALFA notebook in the control room has more details on GALSPECT
operation. 

\end{enumerate}

---------------------------------  much time passes observing  ----------------------------------

\item {\bf Stopping at the end of the run} \begin{enumerate}

\item On {\it observer2}, on the ``AO Observer Display'' click ``Abort
Observation''. Wait a moment until everything stops. If it doesn't stop,
keep typing ``Abort observation'' until it does.

\item On {\it dataview}'s {\it galfa1} window (the
one which prints numbers all the time) press Control-C. This should stop
GALSPECT. If it doesn't, keep hitting Control-C.

\item On {\it observer2}, on the ``Observers Interface'' window, click ``Exit
Normally'' to exit from CIMA. 

\item {\bf IMPORTANT! Fill in the observing log, putting the date next
to the observing file you just finished so that we all know it has been done!}

\end{enumerate}


\end{enumerate}

{\bf Thank you very much!}

Carl and Josh
