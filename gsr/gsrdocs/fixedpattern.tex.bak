\title{SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIXED PATTERN NOISE ON ALFA}

\author{Carl Heiles (\today)}

\section{INTRODUCTION}

	Accuracy of the spectra taken with ALFA and LBW are limited by
systematic baseline wiggles that change slowly, or perhaps not at all,
with time.  After a few second of integration, this {\it fixed pattern
noise}, or {\it FPN}, dominates the uncertainty in the spectrum.  It
tends to have frequency structure of width $\gtrsim 1$ MHz, which is
comparable to time delays of $\lesssim 1$ $\mu$sec in the
autocorrelation function.  We stronbly believe that the structure
results from reflections, the path differences are $\lesssim 100$ m.  1
MHz corresponds to 200 km/s at the HI line---a velocity scale in which
lots of interesting things happen, scientifically speaking.  We
performed some experiments to determine some of its characteristics, of
which we report in this document. 

\section{SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT FINDINGS}

	In this section we briefly summarize our most interesting
findings. We document each in later sections with data and more
discussion. \begin{enumerate}

	\item For a given feed, the FPN is much smaller {\bf***how much}
for the sum of two receivers than for each receiver itself. Thus, the
reflections that produce the FPN are polarized and when the orthogonal 
polarizations are averaged the FPN decreases.

	\item The FPN for feed 0 is much smaller {\bf***how much} than
for the other feeds. Feed 0 is the central on-axis feed. The six
outrigger feeds are off-axis and perhaps see more radiation that is
diffracted around the entrance of the Gregorian dome.

	\item The FPN amplitude increases towards lower frequencies. 
This suggests that the reflections are not purely specular, but at least
partly diffractive, and that they are produced by structures whose sizes
are comparable to the wavelengths involved---maybe the structural beams
on the platform. 

	\item The FPN changes when the ALFA turret is rotated. The
further the rotation, the larger the change. This strongly suggests
that reflections produce the FPN.

	\item When the ALFA turret is rotated $60 ^\circ$, which is the
angular separation of the 6 outrigger feeds, the pattern switches from
one receiver to the one that took its place. (This is a simplification:
the switch is not perfect and changes depending on which direction the
rotation occurs). This clinches the case for reflections!
\end{enumerate}

\ref{rcvr1011}, and \ref{feed05}} \label{figexp1}

\end{figure}

	The formats of these three figures are identical.  Each figure
shows a pair of spectral plots in two panels to save space.  The spectra
are polynomial-flattened RF powers obtained from the Least-Squares
Frequency Switching (LSFS, a.k.a.\ SMARTF) procedure.  They are shown
versus r.f.\ frequency and the area near the 21-cm line (1420.4 MHz) has
been zeroed.  Each panel shows 12 plots for a specific receiver or feed;
the zeros are offset by 0.5 K for clarity and the tags on the right,
outside the plot boundary, indicate the conditions for that plot.  Each
plot shows a specific condition and time ordering of the measurements
increases from bottom to top, with about 60 seconds integration for each
plot. 

	The tags on the right show two quantities.  For each spectrum,
the first is the rms of that spectrum in milliK.  The second indicates
the ALFA turret angle, which steps in geometric incrementals in
geometrically from $0 ^\circ$ to $+60 ^\circ$, then to $-60 ^\circ$, and then
back to $0 ^\circ$.  Near the top, the two plots labelled with a ``P''
indicate that the platform was lowered by 5 inches.  The first plot, at
the bottom, is the spectrum for the first measurement of the series of
13; it has ALFA turret angle $0 ^\circ$.  All the other plots are {\it
differences} between its particular spectrum and the first spectrum. 
This is why the very top plot, which was also taken at ALFA turret angle
$0 ^\circ$ (but about 30 minutes later), is so small. 

\section{BEAM 0 SHOWS THAT THE FPN IS ESSENTIALLY 100\% POLARIZED}

	First let's take a look at the on-axis feed 0, which is served
by receivers 0 and 1.  This feed is almost on-axis, so when we rotate
the ALFA turret all that happens is the feed rotates with only a little
translation---in other words, the polarization position angle changes. 
Look at Figure \ref{rcvr01}, which shows the difference between
receivers 0 and 1 for different position angles.  As we move away from
ALFA angle 0, the difference spectra rms's get larger.  This reflects
the polarization of the FPN.  Note, in particular, the spectra at ALFA
angles $30 ^\circ$ and $60 ^\circ$: they are essentially identical.  This is
consistent with polarization, because these two ALFA angles are both $15
^\circ$ away from being at $90 ^\circ$; each spectrum is showin the same
combination of Stokes Q and U.  {\it This proves that the FPN is
polarized.}

	The fluctuations in the two receivers, which have orthogonal
linear polarizations, are completely uncorrelated.  For the ALFA turret
angle $0 ^\circ$ spectrum, the rms of the difference between the two
receivers' spectra is 163 milliK and that of the sum is 164 milliK,
which is close enough to equality to consider the spectral fluctuations
in the two receivers to be completely uncorrelateed and independent. 

	For off-axis feeds we can make the equivalent of Figure
\ref{rcvr01}; for feed 5 we show the plots for its receivers 10 and 11
in Figure \ref{rcvr1011}. We show this for fun only because it doesn't
mean much: the native linear polarizations in all feeds are oriented
identically on the sky, so as we rotate the ALFA angle we also rotate
the orientation of the linear polarizations to which a feed responds.
Because the FPN is itself polarized, the response of individual
receivers contains this changing polarization. Instead of looking at
individaul receivers for a feed, we have to look at their sum so that
the polarization of the FPN doesn't confuse us.

\section{DEPENDENCE OF FPN ON ALFA TURRET ANGLE} \label{turret}

	Figure \ref{feed05} shows the spectra for the on-axis feed 0
(top panel) and the off-axis feed 5 (bottom panel).  Note that these are
averages of both receivers, so FPN polarization plays no role in these
plots.  As we increase the ALFA turret angle away from $0^\circ$, the
FPN of the difference spectra rise.  (These are difference spectra, each
spectrum minus the one for turret angle 0).  The rms for feed 0 rises
modestly, by no more than a factor of 2.  This as it should be: when we
rotate the ALFA turret, all we are doing is rotataing feed 0, so when we
add the polarizations we expect zero effect.  The residual effect that
we do see is almost certainly produced by feed 0 being slightly off-axis
(by design). 

	For the outrigger feeds the FPN changes quite rapidly with
turret angle.  For example, for turret angle $8^\circ$, for beam 5 the
rms of the difference spectrum is almost half the value of the
turret-angle 0 spectrum.  Thus, even at $8^\circ$ turret angle, the FPN
has changed a lot from its pattern at $0^\circ$. 

\section{DEPENDENCE OF FPN ON BEAM} \label{beam}

	There is no comprehensible systematics in variation of the FPN
rms from beam to beam.  A grand average over {\it all} of the 12
measurement conditions gives, for the 7 beams, rms's of [83, 62, 79, 83,
81, 84, 78] milliK.  This average mixes all of the ALFA turret angles
that we sampled.  If we restrict the average to turret angle 0, we
obtain [81, 66, 82, 89, 78, 93, 86] milliK.  For both cases, feed 1 is
significantly smaller than the others; the others are comparable to each
other.  Feeds 1 and 6 are the ``downhill'' feeds, closest to the center
of the Gregorian dome.  Feeds 3 and 4 are the ``uphill'' feeds.  But it
doesn't seem to matter. 

\section{THE FPN STAYS FIXED IN SPACE WHEN WE ROTATE ALFA BY 60 DEGREES}
\label{interchange}

	If the FPN is from reflections, then it should be fixed in
space.  When we rotate the ALFA turret by $60^\circ$, thus interchanging
one feed for another, the newly-interchanged feed should see the same
FPN that the original one did.  This is, in fact, the case.  However,
the FPN interchanges are not perfect: they change a bit from one feed to
the another, and rotations involving turret angle $+60^\circ$ rotations
produce less good interchanges. 

\begin{figure}[!p]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{ccfplot.ps}   
%\includegraphics[width=6in, height=4in]{rcvrplot1.ps}   
\end{center}
\caption{Difference spectra for ALFA turret angles $-60^\circ$, $0^\circ$, and
$60^\circ$. In each panel, the top spectrum is the ``self difference''
and the bottom one the ``interchange difference''. The latter is the
spectrum of the interchanged receiver minus that of the original. See
text! \label{ccfplot}}
\end{figure}

	First, let us define the terms {\it self difference} and {\it
interchange difference}. These differences are between receivers at two
different turret angles that differ by $60^\circ$ or $120^\circ$. The
self difference is between the same feed at the two angles. The
intechange difference is the difference between the original feed and
the one that occupied the same physical location after the rotation. 

	We show three cases in Figure \ref{ccfplot}.  The top panel
compares turret angles $[-60^\circ, 0^\circ]$; the middle, $[+60^\circ,
0^\circ]$; and the bottom, $[60^\circ,-60^\circ]$.  We subtract feed 5's
spectrum at the first angle from its spectrum at the second angle (upper
plot in each panel); and from the spectrum of its interchange pargner
(lower plot). 

	For each panel, the interchange difference (lower plot) looks
less noisy than the self difference.  This proves that the FPN stays
fixed in space and as the feeds rotate they sample the same reflections
in space.  However, the interchange difference isn't just thermal noise,
so there is more to the story.  Either there is an additional
contributor to FPN that is receiver-based, or there are mechanical
imperfections or anamolies.  We don't think the receivers themselves
have any intrinsic FPN because of tests we did in July 2005: we
obvserved with the ALFA cover on and there was {\it no} FPN. 

	We suspect that the imperfect interchange of FPN occurs because
of mechanical considerations.  Two possibilities are: the feeds do not
interchange perfectly when they rotate because they are not mounted with
perfect symmetry with respect to the optical axis{\footnote{We know this
is true to some degree, because beam 0 is purposly mounted slightly off
of the optical axis (Cort\'ez-Medellin 2002).}; and the rotation changes the locations of
reflecting surfaces within the Gregorian. 

	We chose our three examples in Figure \ref{ccfplot} from many
possible pairs.  We inspected all pairs from matrices of the rms's for
all the difference spectra.  The turret angle pair $[-60^\circ,
0^\circ]$ has somewhat smaller rms's for the interchange spectra than
the other pairs, which involve $+60^\circ$.  Perhaps there is some
mechanical phenomenon that occurs for turret angle $+60^\circ$. 

\section{BEHAVIOR OF THE FPN WITH PLATFORM HEIGHT}
\label{PLATFORM}

	A well known reflection is that between the bottom of the bowl
and the feed, Gregorian, or platform.  If we change the platform height
while keeping all other conditions the same, we change the phase of
these reflections and we can see what happens.  Here we look at two
feeds, the on-axis feed 0 and feed 5 as a representative; all of the
off-axis feeds looked similar.  We have two platform-moved datasets, one
at ALFA turret angle $-60^\circ$ and one at angle $0^\circ$; the mighty
Phil moved the great weight of the platform down by 5 inches for these
two angles, and then lifted it back up. 

\subsection{Plots of spectra--Kelvins versus frequency}
\begin{figure}[!p]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{platform11.ps}   
\end{center}
\caption{Difference spectra for ALFA turret angle $0^\circ$. 
The top panel is feed 0 and the bottom feed 5. In each panel,
the top spectrum is the difference spectrum for the two platform heights
and the bottom spectrum is one of the spectra. \label{platform11}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!p]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{platform9.ps}   
\end{center}
\caption{Difference spectra for ALFA turret angle $-60^\circ$. 
The top panel is feed 0 and the bottom feed 5. In each panel,
the top spectrum is the difference spectrum for the two platform heights
and the bottom spectrum is one of the spectra. \label{platform9}}
\end{figure}

	Figure \ref{platform11} shows the dependence on platform height
for ALFA turret angle 0. This is what we'd expect: nearly everyhing
should cancel out in the upper diffference plots, and what remains
should be a rapid ripple with period $\sim 1$ MHz, which reflects the
$\sim 1$ millisec delay time of the feed-to-bowl reflection. Both the
on-axis and off-axis beams have roughly the same behavior.

	Figure \ref{platform9} is a completely different story. Feed 0
shows the same, expected, behavior as in Figure \ref{platform11}. But
look at feed 5---it's completely different! The difference spectrum
doesn't cancel out at all. Rather, it looks similar in shape to the
actual spectrum! {\it All} of the off-axis feeds show this same effect!

\subsection{Plots of autocorrelation functions---Kelvins versus time delay}

	Figures \ref{platformft11} and \ref{platformft9} are the
autocorrelation function (acf) equivalents of figures \ref{platform11} and
\ref{platform9}.  The acf is the Fourier transform of the power
spectrum and vice-versa. A peak in the acf indicates a reflection with a
corresponding round-trip time delay. The distance for 1 $\mu$sec is
about 1000 ft, which is about twice the distance between the feed and
the bottom of the bowl. 

\begin{figure}[!p]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{platform_ft11.ps}   
\end{center}
\caption{ACF's for ALFA turret angle $0^\circ$. 
The top panel is feed 0 and the bottom feed 5. In each panel,
the top acf is the difference between acf's for the two platform heights
and the bottom acf is one of those acf's. Time delay in $\mu$sec;
KELVINS is the amplitude of the Fourier component. \label{platformft11}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!p]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{platform_ft9.ps}   
\end{center}
\caption{ACF's for ALFA turret angle $-60^\circ$. 
The top panel is feed 0 and the bottom feed 5. In each panel,
the top acf is the difference between acf's for the two platform heights
and the bottom acf is one of those acf's. Time delay in $\mu$sec;
KELVINS is the amplitude of the Fourier component. \label{platformft9}}
\end{figure}

	Figure \ref{platformft11} shows the acf'ss for feed 0 (top panel)
and feed 5 (bottom panel) for ALFA turret angle 0.  The behavior is
somewhat curious.  For beam 5, the difference acf has a single sharp
spike at 0.91 $\mu$sec.  For beam 0, the difference has a
dominant peak at $0.91$ $\mu$sec but it's rattier, with
substantial peaks at 1.04 and 1.16 $\mu$sec, as well as a broader
underlying shelf runing from about 0.7 to 1.4 $\mu$sec.  (We
conservatively estimate the acccuracy of all quoted times to be $\pm
0.005$ $\mu$sec; the time resolution is 0.01 $\mu$sec). 

	Figure \ref{platformft9} shows the acf for feed 0 (top panel)
and feed 5 ( bottom panel) for ALFA turret angle $-60^\circ$.  The
behavior is a lot wierder than in Figure \ref{platformft11} for angle
$0^\circ$.  Here, for the difference acf for feed 5, instead of the nice
single sharp peak in figure \ref{platformft11} we have a very broad
response that covers roughly the same time delays as the acf's
themselves.  The two peaks near 0.9 $\mu$s are barely recognizable; they
have delays 0.90 and 0.94 $\mu$s.  The 0.90 $\mu$sec peak differs from
the prominent turret angle 0 peak by 0.01 $\mu$s, equivalent to a total path of
$\sim 10$ feet.  This ratty behavior for feed 5 is, of course, exactly
what we expect from looking at the frequency spectra in Figure
\ref{platform9}.  For beam 0, we have the same three dominant spikes as
before at 0.91, 1.04, and 1.16 $\mu$sec, together with the broad
uinderlying shelf, but there is also substantial power below $\sim 0.4$
$\mu$s. 

	It's hard to understand why there should be such a difference
between turret angles $-60^\circ$ and $0^\circ$.  It is worth trying
this experiment again.  These experiments were done during the daytime,
and perhaps a Solar reflection interfered with the data for ALFA turret
angle $-60^\circ$.  On the other hand, the large power for the platform
difference specctrra for feed 5 occurs for all the off-axis feeds as
well, and why should their behavior differ from that of feed 0? Who
knows. 

\section{ZA DEPENDENCE OF FPN} \label{za}

\begin{figure}[!p]

spectum minus the middle one. Labels on the right
indicate: first the rms in milliK, and second the mean $za$ for the spectrum.
\label{zmm05}}
\end{figure}

	Here we examine the $za$ dependence of the FPN.  Figure
\ref{zmm05} shows the FPM for 7 different intervals of $za$ ranging from
$3.0^\circ$ to $19.7^\circ$.  The FPN changes slowly with %za$; the
change from one extreme to the other is comparable to the FPN itself. 
All feeds have about the same behavior.

\end{center}
\caption{Difference acf's for all feeds at $\langle za
\rangle=4.0^\circ$, where the FPN is large (Figure \ref{zmm05}).  Feed
number increases upwards.  The difference acf is the Fourier transform
of the spectrum minus the spectrum at $za = 12.5^\circ$.  Feed number
increases upwards.  \label{zamm_ft0}}
\end{figure}

increases upwards.  \label{zamm_ft6}}
\end{figure}

	Figures \ref{zamm_ft0} and \ref{zamm_ft6} show, for all feeds,
the acf's of the difference between the spectra at $\langle za \rangle=[4.0^\circ,
19.7^\circ]$ and those at $\langle za \rangle = 12.5^\circ$.
Most of the energy resides below delays of a $\mu$s, and there are few
prominent peaks.

	In Figure \ref{zamm_ft0}, the prominent peaks for feed 0 are at 0.91 and
1.04 $\mu$s; the prominent peak for feed 6 is at 0.90 $\mu$s.  In Figure
\ref{zamm_ft6}, the prominent peak in several spectra is at 1.04 $\mu$s;
the prominent peak for feed 3 is at 0.79 $\mu$s. 

\section{AZ DEPENDENCE OF FPN} \label{az}

\begin{figure}[!p]

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!p]

\end{center}
\caption{ACF of the $az$ difference spectra for all
feeds at $az=189^\circ$ (Fourier transforms of the topmost spectra in

0.79, 0.90, 0.98, and 1.04 $\mu$s. 
\label{azmm_ft}}
\end{figure}

	Here we examine the $az$ dependence of the FPN.  Figure
\ref{azmm05} shows the FPM for 7 different intervals of $az$ ranging
from $269^\circ$ to $189^\circ$ in increments of $\sim -20^\circ$.  The
columns of numbers on the right hand side of the plots indicate, first,
the rms of the spectrum; and second, the mean $az$.  All of these except
the third from the bottom (which is the reference spectrum) are
difference spectra, equal to the spectrum itself minus the reference
spectrum.  All of these data are at $za=18^\circ$ except the bottom one,
which is at $za \sim 19.5^\circ$; this $za$ difference probably
explains the larger difference spectrum. 

	As $az$ changes the spectra change slowly; you need to go $\sim
40^\circ$ before the differences become comparable to the FPN itself.
We examined the rms's for all feeds and found that the uphill feeds 3
and 4 have a $\sim 30\%$ larger rms for the top spectrum than the other
feeds. This probably occurs because these feeds see a bit more of the
ground than the other feeds. If so, these small feed-to-feed differences
with $az$ should disappear at smaller $za$. 

	Figure \ref{azmm_ft} shows the acf's for the topmost spectra in
Figure \ref{azmm05}, for all 7 feeds.  The prominent
peaks occur at 0.79, 0.90, 0.98, and 1.04 $\mu$s; some peaks appear in some
feeds and not others. Feed 0, the on-axis feed, has the most prominent
peaks.

\section{FREQUENCY DEPENDENCE OF FPN} \label{freq}

	Look at all of the preceding plots: the amplitude of the FPN
increases towards lower frequencies.  This suggests that the reflections
are not purely specular, but at least partly diffractive, and that they
are produced by structures whose sizes are comparable to the wavelengths
involved---maybe the structural beams on the platform. 

	This frequency dependence has important ramifications for the
representation of the FPN by Fourier modes. The Fourier representation
is a natural one for reflections because of the acf/power spectrum
relationship. However, the frequency variation of the FPN indicates that
the strength of the reflections varies across our 100 MHz band, which
implies that the Fourier coefficients decrease in amplitude with
increasing frequency---contrary to the basic assumption in Fourier
transforms that the coefficients apply all across the interval being
analyzed. This suggests that a modification of the Fourier
representation is required. Hmmmmmmmmmmm\dots
