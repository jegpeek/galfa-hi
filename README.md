### GALFA-HI Standard Reduction Software

This is the software used to reduce the data presented in GALFA-HI Data Release 2. 

To run this software through all the steps, you will need the

```http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RMOTC0```

This pipeline is provided for completeness; one should not expect to be able to run it just from this repository.
